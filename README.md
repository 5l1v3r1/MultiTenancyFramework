# MultiTenancyFramework
Everything you need to jump-start building multi-tenant applications in C# using any framework of your choice.

The goal of this project is to provide the framework needed to build multi-tenant .NET applications (also known as Software-as-a-Service, SaaS) while using your preferred choice of ORM (NHibernate, EntityFramework, Dapper etc),
IoC Container (SimpleInjector, AutoFac, StructureMap, Unity, etc) and web frameworks (MVC, NancyFx).
